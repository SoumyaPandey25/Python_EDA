Dataset contains student demographic and academic information with 145 rows and 33 columns.
No missing values were found in the dataset.
Several numerical columns are encoded categorical variables, so descriptive statistics were mainly used for range validation.
CGPA distributions show slight variation with some extreme values.
Outliers were detected using the IQR method on CGPA but were retained as they represent valid academic performance.
Correlation analysis shows a strong relationship between last semester CGPA and expected graduation CGPA.
Correlation does not imply causation.
