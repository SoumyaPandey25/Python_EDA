## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis & Outlier Detection

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Students Performance dataset using Python 🐍.

---
## 🔍 Steps performed:

- Data loading and basic inspection
- Descriptive statistics and data understanding
- Missing value analysis
- Distribution visualization using histograms and boxplots
- Outlier detection using the IQR method
- Correlation analysis between academic performance metrics
- Exporting the cleaned dataset

---

📌 Outliers were retained with proper justification, as extreme academic scores represent genuine student performance and removing them could introduce bias.

---
## 🧠 Key takeaway:

Strong correlation was observed between last semester CGPA and expected graduation CGPA.  
Correlation does not imply causation.
